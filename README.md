# Splash-Room-Threejs-VR-Lab

A WebXR application built with Three.js. This project simulates a VR environment where you can shoot balls that leave splash decals on walls and interact with objects in virtual space. 

## Project Goals 
- Demonstrate basic VR interactions in a browser using Three.js.
- Show how to shoot projectiles that create decals on collision.
- Implement simple physics and object collisions.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Serve the files from a local server (e.g., npx http-server, python -m http.server, etc.).
3. Open the provided index.html file in a WebXR-capable browser (e.g., Chrome with the WebXR Emulator Extension).
4. Click the “Enter VR” button (if available) or use the emulator to explore and interact.
